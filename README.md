# MVC Crud Project (11/2017)

<h2>Character Tracker Website</h2>
<h4>Rosanne Ussery</h4>

For this project, I used Java, Spring, Gradle, JSP files, HTML and CSS. The project's objectives were to create a CRUD website where the user can view, update, create, and delete information. Lacking a database, the information is stored in sessions and a treemap for the duration of the session. 

The website is intended to be used by writers for tracking and updating character information for their stories. As such, it has forms for basic character information such as name, age, gender, role in the novel and room for a short backstory.

I found the Spring framework very difficult to understand as it proved challenging to grasp how it connected all of the disparate beans and JSPs together. This contributed to some frustration as I attempted to complete the backend infrastructure for the project.

In order to use the website, load the page and determine which information you would like to enter for your character. 

Instructions for using the website are as follows:

* Navigate to the url below to access the website.
* Enter information for your character, making sure to fill out the entire form. Failing to enter information in any of the five categories will result in an error. 
* Press the button to submit your information. Your new character entry will be displayed on the left under the template characters.
* Any character's information may be updated. In order to do so, simply click the update navigation button beneath the character's name that you wish to modify. 
* Any character can be deleted from the website. Be sure you intend to do this before clicking the button as the decision is irreversible.

Known issues to fix (11.12.17):
Names of characters are presenting as links which lead to nowhere.


Future Feature sets to add:
Better interface<br>
Larger textbox for backstory entry on update page<br>
Error messages for missing information<br>
Database to store the information<br>
Logins for users so they can easily return to their project information<br>
Functionality for users to create novel sets so they can organize characters by projects<br>
