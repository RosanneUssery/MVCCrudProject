# MVC Crud Project (11/2017)

##Character Tracker Website

For this project, I used Java, Spring, Gradle, JSP files, HTML and CSS. The project's objectives were to create a CRUD website where the user can view, update, create, and delete information. Lacking a database, the information is stored in sessions and a treemap for the duration of the session. 

The website is intended to be used by writers for tracking and updating character information for their stories. As such, it has forms for basic character information such as name, age, gender, role in the novel and room for a short backstory. ]

In order to use the website, load the page and determine which information you would like to enter for your character. 

Instructions for using the website are as follows:

* Navigate to the url below to access the website.
* Enter information for your character, making sure to fill out the entire form. Failing to enter information in any of the five categories will result in an error. 
* Press the button to submit your information. Your new character entry will be displayed on the left under the template characters.
* Any character's information may be updated. In order to do so, simply click the update navigation button beneath the character's name that you wish to modify. 
* Any character can be deleted from the website. Be sure you intend to do this before clicking the button as the decision is irreversible.

Known issues:
Update page does not return the user to the original page after entering updated information.
Names of characters are presenting as links which lead to nowhere.

To do:
Create a header for the page 
Add padding around column margins
Change font color for right hand column
Add error messages for missing information
<strike>Create a delete confirm popup for the delete button</strike>
